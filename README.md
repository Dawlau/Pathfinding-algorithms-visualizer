# Pathfinding algorithms visualizer

This is a visualizer for the most popular pathfinding algorithms.

This app was made with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/), [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). Most of the project was done using basic Python. Pygame was used for GUI and Event Handling and Tkinter was used for additional windows that pop-up.


## Features

This app supports visualizing 4 algorithms:

1. [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
2. [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
3. [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
4. [Greedy Best-first Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)


In the home screen you have two buttons: "Start" and "How to use".
"Start" button starts the app, while by pressing "How to use" button a window with instructions pops-up.
